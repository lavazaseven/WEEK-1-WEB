           <h3>Our Story</h3>
           <p>Founded in 2023, birthdaytree initiative kenya began with a single idea: Instead of traditional birthday gifts, why not plant a tree seedling? What started as a small personal project by our founder MR Reynold Ajega Lavaza in his rural home in vihiga county,Kenya has grown into a national wide movement.</p>
